This file contains links to pages that are used to download games, torrents, cracked software installation files and that use web servers which you can see in the content of the file.

I created this compilation of sites, since a client asked me how he could block these sites, and my expression was: MMMMMMMMMM, impossible to do them, the internet is very big and there are many ways to get to this, but with some options, restrictions and THIS FILE , we can do something that will make it difficult.
